# Automated Vulnerability Scanning & Exploitation

## 1. Introduction
A comprehensive penetration testing utility designed to standardize the reconnaissance and enumeration phases of a security engagement.
The script chains multiple industry-standard tools into a single, high-efficiency pipeline.

## 2. Key Features
* **Target Validation:** Uses Nmap "List Scans" (-sL) to verify IP ranges before committing resources.
* **Intelligent Discovery:** Performs rapid "First Scans" to create a "Kill List" of active hosts, optimizing subsequent deep scans.
* **Dual-Mode Scanning:** *
    * **Basic:** Standard TCP/UDP service detection.
    * **Full:** Leverages Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) and automatically correlates service versions with SearchSploit exploits.
* **Credential Auditing:** Automatically triggers Hydra against identified login services (SSH, FTP, RDP, SMB) using parallel thread optimization.
* **Dynamic Port Mapping:** Programmatically maps open ports to their respective protocols for targeted brute-forcing.

## 3. Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Vulnerability Correlation:** Automated translation of raw Nmap XML data into actionable threat intelligence via Exploit-DB.
* **Protocol Automation:** Developed complex logic to identify and audit specific network services.
* **Data Integrity:** Implementation of structured logging, error handling (stderr redirection), and automated evidence archiving.

## 4. Requirements
* Kali Linux.
* Root privileges (required for SYN scans and OS detection).
* Pre-installed: nmap, searchsploit, and hydra.
