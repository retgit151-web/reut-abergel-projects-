# Welcome to my project showcase repository 🛡️

This repository serves as a showcase of my technical projects across Red Team and Blue Team disciplines.
Each directory contains practical tools and research I've developed during my journey in cybersecurity.

## 📂 What's Inside?
In each project folder, you will find:
* **Project README:** A dedicated file explaining the specific project's goals and usage.
* **Detailed PDF Documentation:** A walkthrough of the project, methodology, and results.
* **Encoded Scripts:** The functional version of the tool/automation script.

### Project Categories
* **Linux Info Automation:** Scripting for system auditing and data collection.

## 🔐 Code Access

To maintain security best practices and protect the integrity of the source code, I have uploaded the scripts in an encoded format.

**Want to see the raw source code?**
If you are a recruiter or a fellow researcher and would like to review the logic behind the scripts, please feel free to reach out!
I am happy to share the full source code and discuss my development process with you.
